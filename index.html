        <h1>From your Izumi to you, my dear Ashi. ♡♡♡♡♡</h1>
        <p>My Ashi, what do I even say? I swear I don't know what to say, but, here I go... I'm always thinking about you. Every moment, every thought in the present and every thought of the future. There could be a billion things in my mind and you'd still be 99.99% of them.</p>

        <p>My Ashi, you make me feel so incredibly lucky and happy every day. You make me smile every day, one way or another. You, my love, give me a reason to keep going, to work, and to live. You are my answer for everything I do now and work towards, you are my reason.<br>
        You make me feel worth as a person, you make me feel seen, you make me feel human, just by being your sweet, caring self. You are so incredibly good to me, you always are.</p>

        <p>I love you. I love talking to you, I love listening to you for hours on end, I could listen to you and talk to you forever, even if it's about nothing. I love hearing about you, how you are, what you're thinking, what you want to do, what's going on in your mind and how you're feeling, even when you're not feeling the best, are overstimulated, annoyed, or whatever else.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the tiniest, tiniest things you do for me, even the ones you deem insignificant. I love how caring you are, what you want to do for those around you and what you do for those around you. Genuinely.<br>
        And... I've never felt more content, full and happy before, as much as I do now with you, by being yours and just talking to you. My heart might actually jump out of my chest and grab your tightly the day we meet. Hehe.</p>

        <p>You're the first person I think of when I wake up, you're the first person I talk to in the morning, you're the person in all my thoughts, and your notification is the only one I look for every day - throughout the whole day, and you're the last thought in my head every day before I fall asleep.</p>

        <p>You've taught me so many things. To care, to love, to live in the moment, you want to make me be even better, work on myself and improve as a person. You've taught me to be human, to let myself be myself, to express myself without a guard and so much more.<br>
        I look forward to our future together so much. From the tiniest moments in life, the quietest moments even, those filled with much warmth and bigger things in our lives.</p>

        <p>I want to make you feel like the happiest, luckiest, spoiled and the best treated. I just want to see you happy, I want to make your day, I want to see you grow and learn too.<br>
        But even in your lowest of lows, I want to be there for you. I don't want you to have to face things alone, I don't want you to feel burdened or that you're a burden. Till the very last beat of my heart, the last blink of my eyes and the last neuron firing in my brain, you're going to be loved, cared about, and valued, at least by me, and until then you'll always have someone, you'll have me and I'll do anything to see that soft smile of yours to show.<br>
        Even when you can't smile, I'll be there with you, whether sitting with you in silence or consoling you however, reminding you that I'm here for you and that you're never going to be alone as long as I'm breathing. I'll be the one who'll sit with you through the silence, through everything until the sun shines through the eye of the storm.</p>

        <p>No matter what fucking hurdle life has in store, no matter how harsh reality gets, no matter how messy life gets, I choose you. Through thick and thin, the high and lows and everything in between, because you're worth it all and then more for me.<br>
        You're not perfect but, you're more than what I could ever ask for, want or need in this life and a trillion others. I don't want what we have with anyone else, I can't even think of it, I only want you, my baby, my love, my Ashi, my home, my world, my everything.<br>
        You are where my heart resides, you are my home and my world, you have my heart just as I have yours. And your heart... I'll treat it better than and take care of it more than the most valuable thing to ever exist, because your heart to me is more valuable than that.</p>
